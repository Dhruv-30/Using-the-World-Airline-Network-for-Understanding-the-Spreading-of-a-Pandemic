# Using-the-World-Airline-Network-for-Understanding-the-Spreading-of-a-Pandemic

This paper explores how an epidemic can spread through a global air travel network and become a global pandemic using an SIR model. Different network types were explored, SIR scenarios were tested (using different recovery and transmission rates) and random node and eigenvector node removal was undertaken. A lower infection rate (tau) compared to recovery rate results in an overall lower infection time of the network. To prevent a pandemic from spreading the removal of eigenvector central nodes could be an effective approach.


Dataset taken and cleaned from Open Flights database. 
Paper comprises of 4 main tasks using tools such as GEPHI and Python (EoN, SIR, etc. libraries).
